# Shakespeare is the stageplay of git!
This is a playground for weavermarquez's git experiments. 

This repository is a place to experiment with git and github features. It was made following [Front End Foxes' GitHub Basics](https://github.com/FrontEndFoxes/school-curriculum/blob/main/1-getting-started-lessons/1-github-basics/README.md).

## What to look forward to
This document will contain various notes on different parts of a repository.

### README.md
GitHub's [helpful guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes#auto-generated-table-of-contents-for-readme-files) on README files are a great way to get started on READMEs. This document is an attempt ot get better at writing them.

Additional notes on READMEs can be found [here](./notes-on-readmes.md).

### CONTRIBUTE.md
GitHub also provides an introduction to [contribution guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors#examples-of-contribution-guidelines), which are critical elements to onboarding any participant in an open source project.

You can read our contribution guidelines [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
